1 : If you don't have Python 3 installed on your Mac, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/. Once the download is complete, open the installer and follow the installation instructions.

2 : Open Terminal on your Mac. You can do this by going to the Launchpad and typing "Terminal" in the search bar.

In Terminal, install the Selenium package by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

pip3 install selenium

3 : Download the Chromedriver from the official website: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads and installed it (make sure it's the same version as your chrome)

4 : In the Python file, replace the following lines  (26/27) of code with your actual email and password for your account

email = "Your email or number without any spaces"
password = "Your password without any spaces"


5 : In Terminal, navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved. For example, if the file is saved in the Downloads folder, you can type the following command and press Enter:
cd Downloads

6 : Now, to run the Python file, type the following command and press Enter:
python3 bot.py
