Don't forget to install the requirements before you run this program!
You can do that easily by running "pip install -r requirements.txt" in your terminal.

Create a new empty directory to store all the program's data.
Just put the directory path after the "=" sign on line 18.

After you've logged in for the first time, you can speed up future logins.
To do that, just comment out line 31 and remove the "#" sign from line 30. Easy-peasy

If you run into any issues during the installation or running of the program,
